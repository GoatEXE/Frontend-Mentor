# Introduction
In this repository, I'll be keeping all the projects I've done for the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/GoatEXE) community. I find it annoying to keep up with so many repositories, so this is easier for me to manage.

# Usage
The index.html file within root is hosted by default, but you can plug in any named directory to view any project you're interested in. For example: `https://goatexe.github.io/Frontend-Mentor/1-qr-code/` will take you to my day 1 [example project](https://goatexe.github.io/Frontend-Mentor/1-qr-code/). Replace the `1-qr-code` portion of the URL with the actual directory name.
