## My process

### What I learned

It's been a while since I've jumped into front-end, and I was embarrassed that this took me longer than I thought it would. Ultimately, I had forgotten how you center text within a container. Funnily enough, you can imagine the face-palm I emotionally went through when I remembered it was that simple.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  text-align: center;
}
```


### Continued development

From now on, I promise I will never forget text centering.
