## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

I found myself chewing a significant amount of time revisiting methods in which to correctly correctly center elements, and ruining relationships with other elements when being centered. I learned that my comfort zone is for sure within bootstrap. 


### Continued development

I'm uneasy to remove my dependency from Bootstrap 5. The ease that it brings to my style is just too much to consider doing the rest manually otherwise. I should still consider revisiting this to prove myself otherwise.
