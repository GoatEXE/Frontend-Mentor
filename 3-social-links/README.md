## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- Solution URL: [3-social-links](https://goatexe.github.io/Frontend-Mentor/3-social-links)

## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap 5.3

### What I learned

This is pretty similar to the other two projects, so I'm not sure that I'm learning very much. Getting muscle memory is nice though.


### Continued development

I'm having fun with these projects and looking forward to more. I'll continue to take this seriously. On 2nd thought, I find it funny that I said this given what the buttons link to.
